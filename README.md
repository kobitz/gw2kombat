This is a modification of the other combat mods that exist. The assigned toggle key (default Alt) toggles holding the right mouse button and allows you to hotkey other buttons to left and right mouse button. It also paints a crosshair where you are aiming. The way I paint the crosshair is unique from other combat mods. Its just minor tweaks to whats already out there to fit my taste. Doesn't work with full screen.

**Feature List:**

- **Camera Lock**: Toggle key (Default Alt) engages camera lock by simulating holding the right mouse button down.

- **Hotkey Mouse Buttons**: Able to hotkey anything to left or right mouse button as well as mouse wheel up and down.

- **Smart Targetting**: Lets you set up auto target for select hotkeys. Turn auto target off and assign "Lock Auto Target" in Guild Wars 2 to "U" to try it out. Works with or without auto targeting with slightly different results. Checkboxes determine hotkeys you want to trigger the target key being held.

- **Hotkey Anything**: All hotkeys follow a basic Key > Event structure. The first box is the key(the button you hit to initiate the action) and the second box is the event(the key it sends to the game to perform the action). By default these should work with default Guild Wars 2 setting, any custom hotkeys you want to use with smart target must be set.

- **No Lock Key**: Able to hotkey something that can only be done while the camera is unlocked. Try binding your About Face Key to two adjacent No Lock Key boxes to try it out. Also useful for precision aiming skills.

- **Custom Crosshairs**: Able to drag and drop in your own crosshairs. Currently requires you to make about 18 copies but that should be fixed once I finish the rotator. For now if copying your own is too much trouble there is a wide selection by default.

- **Scalable Crosshair**: Able to scale crosshairs in settings.

- **Crosshair Rotate**: based on cursor movement. (WIP)

- **Rubber Mouse** Rubber banding of the mouse cursor, has a neat effect. Elasticity variable has a slider so you can choose how loose it feels. default is recomended personally.

- **Crosshair Perspective**: Modifying the axis the cursor is drawn on, making the camera move faster or slower than the crosshair. (hard to explain, better to just mess with the crosshair perspective slider if you wanna know what I mean). default is recommended.

- **Windowed Mode Support** Support for Windowed as well as Windowed Fullscreen Mode. Does not work in Fullscreen.

- **Voice Notifications** *(Currently Not Working with Windows 10)* Has a voice program built in that tells you when its on or locked. has support for multiple languages, still haven't made it easy to switch though. Will prolly eventually add more voice stuff and translation options so its multilingual or something.
*Change volume in windows volume mixer*

- **Auto Unlock**: Unlocks when you use basic UI hotkeys like "I" for inventory or hitting Enter to type. Pretty sure I covered all the default GW2 hotkeys for UI elements and also stuff like Alt Tab and all that.



- ***Bonus "ShiftDodge" script included***: added ShiftDodge bonus script. alows use of shift while standing still, and dodges while moving and holding shift. Works with "v" dodge key by default. can be easily modified.


Scared of ban?
