Guild Wars 2 Custom Combat Mod BETA

Change volume in windows volume mixer.

Make sure you have latest AHK.

http://ahkscript.org

Settings.exe to open settings panel.

default setting should work with default gw2 settings.

Mess with sliders to get a good feel.

Default settings are suggested.

Check boxes are for setup with LockAutoTarget, 

items with boxes checked will hit the target lock key changing your target to the one under your cursor

default hotkeys are similar to ingame. 1 presses 1, 2 presses 2, etc. These can be changed to fit your hotkeys.

NoLockKey means this key will unlock the camera while being used.

Actions like About Face require this sort of thing.

Bind your About Face Key to the No Lock Key for both boxes.

please report any issues.

Crosshair Rotation is WIP

Delete settings.ini to reset to default settings

This is a modification of the other combat mods that exist. The assigned toggle key (default Alt) toggles holding the right mouse button and allows you to hotkey other buttons to left and right mouse button. It also paints a crosshair where you are aiming. The way I paint the crosshair is unique from other combat mods, I put in a rubber band effect and rotate the crosshair. Its just minor tweaks to whats already out there to fit my taste. It also has a Smart Targetting system that works with the built in Lock Auto Target function in GW2. Checkboxes choose which abilities smart target, hotkey Lock Auto Target to "U" by default in GW2. Try it with auto target on or off. It should work well either way if the hotkeys are set up right. should not interfere with default tab targetting.
