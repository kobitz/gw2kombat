Settings.exe to open settings panel.

default setting should work with default gw2 settings.

Mess with sliders to get a good feel.

Default settings are suggested.

Check boxes are for setup with LockAutoTarget, 

items with boxes checked will hit the target lock key changing your target to the one under your cursor

default hotkeys are similar to ingame. 1 presses 1, 2 presses 2, etc. These can be changed to fit your hotkeys.

NoLockKey means this key will unlock the camera while being used.

Actions like About Face require this sort of thing.

Bind your About Face Key to the No Lock Key for both boxes.

please report any issues.
